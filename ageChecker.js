// 1. Define a constant `age` with a numerical value representing a person's age. For
// example, you can set `const age = 18;` to represent a person who is 18 years old.
// 2. Use a ternary operator to check the person's age and assign a message to a variable
// `message`. If the person is 18 or older, the message should say "You are eligible to
// vote." Otherwise, the message should say "You are not eligible to vote."
// 3. Display the `message` to the user.
const age = 67
let eligibility = 
(age >17) ? "You are eligible to vote!" : "You are not eligible to vote"
console.log(eligibility);
